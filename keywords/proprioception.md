## Proprioception

In definition, proprioception is often described as the “sixth sense”, providing unique input beyond the five traditional senses. It is perceiving our body's position and movement in space without relying on visual or tactile cues. This unconscious awareness enables us to comprehend how the parts of our body and mind relate to each other, and how they interact with the environment. Unlike the five senses, proprioception is less consciously discerned but plays a crucial role in embodiment, self-understanding and sensory interpretation [^1][^2][^3]. 

From a metaphysical standpoint, proprioception blurs the lines between the mind and body. Dualistic frameworks outlined by classical philosophy separate the mind from the body, but proprioception demonstrates an integrated model where bodily awareness and one’s mental state are interdependent[^4]. Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty argues that perception is not a passive reception of external stimuli, but rather an active bodily engagement with the world [^5]. This said, If I know my hand’s position through an immediate, pre-reflective sense, then my mental state is inseparable from my physical state. Thus the mental and physical are not merely correlated, but co-constitutive. Further discussions on the role of proprioception on the self are perhaps beyond the scope of this keyword, though classmates can consult “Perception and the physical world” by D.M Armstrong [^6] for further explorations on the sense’s influence on perception. 

Keeping this in mind, In traditional art, the viewer’s role is often passive, simply observing. New media however, demands active participation, often leveraging proprioception explicitly, engaging the body as both medium and participant. Proprioception’s significance continues to grow as artists seek to create immersive and interactive experiences that engage the user's entire body through various mediums and technologies, including VR & AR, Interactive installations, or more general haptic technologies. New media experiences often respond to the user’s physical body in real-time. This relies heavily on integrating proprioceptive information with the visual and auditory stimuli, or incorporating haptic feedback into digital environments, allowing developers to create more realistic, intuitive, and engaging interactions [^2][^7] Haptic devices provide tactile feedback, simulating the sense of touch and allowing users to interact with virtual objects in a more tangible way as the sense of touch provides crucial information about the body's interaction with its surroundings [^8]. Thus, the body’s state shapes the artwork, while the artwork reshapes the participant’s awareness of their body. This mirrors Merleau-Ponty’s idea of perception as a bodily dialogue with the world, but now the "world" includes a responsive technological layer with visual output in the form of art.

To expand, in class, we examined Char Davies’ Osmose, which immerses users in virtual environments controlled by their movements through VR. Their proprioceptive sense of balance and motion dictated their navigation through ethereal, dreamlike spaces. The artwork doesn’t just represent a world, it responds to the user’s body, blending mental immersion with physical action. This creates a unified experience between output and input, mediated by technology, forming a continuous, hybrid self that includes the technological environment[^9].

We can look at this through a posthuman lens as well, If proprioception reveals a mind-body unity, art like Agnes Meyer-Brandis’ “Cloud Core Scanner” [^10], where participants "feel" cloud textures via haptic feedback, extends that unity into a hybrid symbiosis. My bodily awareness informs the artwork, which reshapes my awareness in turn, mediated by sensors and code. This aligns with Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto [^11], where boundaries between human and machine dissolve, and proprioception becomes a shared property.
