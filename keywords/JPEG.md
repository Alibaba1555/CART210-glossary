## JPEG

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)[^JPEG] is a file format commonly used to compress and store images. It is reffered to as a 
"lossy" format because it compresses and alters the pixel data of the file and is therefore not a "lossless" transfer. It was created in
1992 by the aptly named Joint Photographic Experts Group and they are widely credited with the proliferation of digital imaging with its ease 
of use and storing. 

When pictures are taken using the JPEG compression format, the image data is stored in a RAW (raw data)[^Adobe RAW] file under the .TIFF (Tag Image File Format) file format. When the image is to be stored,
it is then compressed using JPEG and converted to a .JPEG file. When this image is displayed, it is then uncompressed and returned to the RAW format. The method that 
JPEG takes to compression uses the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) method by discarding high-frequency information (such as intensehues and dense packets of data.[^github] 
By discarding this data, it then fills the gap using existing data leading to a lossy compression where high-frequency details are lost and filled in with random data, creating nosie or grain. 

Though the data loss through JPEG compreession can be severe in some cases, it is mostly considered to be a worthwhile sacrifice for the 
amount of space it saves. Even though more formats have since been released and popularized (such as Apple's HEIC format or the PNG format) 
the JPEG format remains the ol' reliable of image compression. The JPEG's longevity can largely be attributed to the fact that it remains one of the
most efficient and loss-neutral compression formats in modern day. Though some desire truly lossless compression, until this is achieved JPEG will still be used 
by photographers, editors, illustrators and digital creators all around the world, and not many formats have any hope of replacing its reach.
